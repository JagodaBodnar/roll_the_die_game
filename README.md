## Instruction
>The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.</br>
Roll the die for the user(generate a Random between 1-6) and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board.</br>
After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.</br>
Repeat this 4 additional times for 5 rolls in total.</br>
However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - they've won.</br>
If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.</br>
Remember there are only 20 spaces on the board, so a message like "You advanced to space 22" is a bug.</br>
